# some instructions
The main code is in armCodesInvKin/servo/servo.ino Run it with Arduino.
But don't forget to install Fabrik2D library beforehand. (if you don't know how search google - how to add a library in arduino)
in serial monitor, you are supposed to provide "x,y,z,tool_angle" hit enter. It will show you angles and move the arm accordingly.
